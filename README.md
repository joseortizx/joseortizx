# 👨‍💻 Hi there, i'm Jose Ortiz 

I'm currently 21 years old and reside in the province of Jujuy, Argentina. I'm a computer engineering student at the National University of Jujuy (UNJU), and my goal is to become a full-stack developer.

My passion for entrepreneurship led me to discover programming, where I found the opportunity to channel my innovative spirit and create solutions to the problems of our day-to-day life. I consider myself a self-taught person with initiative and creativity, always in constant learning to improve my skills and knowledge in the technological world.

In my free time, I enjoy ideating and building projects to test my skills as a developer. If you want to see some of my projects, you can visit my profile on Github. 😛
